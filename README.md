# Helpful UserStyles

UserStyles are custom CSS that runs on web pages in your browser. You need the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) browser extension to run them; it's available [for Chrome and derivatives](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

Once you have Stylus installed, just click on one of the links to a script below. Files with a `.user.css` extension will be detected as userstyles, and you'll be prompted to install them. By default, styles will be auto-updated periodically; you can disable automatic updates and/or manually check for and install updates instead.

You can also write your own scripts, and find many more on [UserStyles.world](https://userstyles.world), [UserStyles Archive](https://uso.kkx.one), and more. Stylus lets you quickly search for styles for the current site.
